1. Architecture Overview.
2. Deployment plan.
	- How much data do we have?
	- Which level of data security needed?
	- How fast data will be transferred and processed?

=> Resources needed, infrastructure decision.

Zookeeper (RAM, CPU, SSD)
Kafka (RAM, CPU, SSD) => expected throughtput (ex: N nodes x 1 node 75M/s = expected).

3. Monitoring.
